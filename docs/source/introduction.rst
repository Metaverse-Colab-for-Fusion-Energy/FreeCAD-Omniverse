Introduction
---------------------

For the field of computer-aided design (CAD), NVIDIA Omniverse presents an opportunity to improve on the workflows currently in place for both the initial design and continuous improvement of engineering components. Mainly, Omniverse serves as a shared 3D model exchange where contributors can create, view, and analyse the same model all while simultaneously conducting simulations in a true-to-life virtual environment. 

The creation and analysis of engineering components in the context of Omniverse can be done using third-party connectors. Connectors offer real-time synchronisation between Omniverse and design and simulation tools currently in use. Due to Omniverse’s open platform, several Omniverse connectors have been developed such as for Unreal Engine, ParaView, and Autodesk Maya, with the potential of developing further connectors through the Connect library.

FreeCAD is a general-purpose 3D computer-aided design tool. While not necessarily the main industry standard for CAD, its’ open-source nature and modular architecture has allowed for introduction of numerous third-party ‘workbench’ tools expanding to a wider range of uses around engineering. 

Currently, NVIDIA does not offer a connector between Omniverse and FreeCAD. Fortunately, the development of such a connector is made straightforward due to the availability of both open Omniverse Connect and FreeCAD Workbench platforms.
