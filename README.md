## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your FreeCAD \Mod directory. Typically, this is 'C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\FreeCAD\Mod'

> Note: if the 'AppData\Roaming\FreeCAD\Mod' file directory does not exist, you must first initialise this folder. To do this, launch FreeCAD, and on the toolbar click 'Tools' > 'Addon Manager'. If you are using the Addon Manager for the first time, a dialog box will open warning you that the addons in the Addon manager are not officially part of FreeCAD. It also presents several options related to the Addon manager's data usage. Adjust those options to your liking and press the 'OK' button to continue. The '\Mod' directory should now exist. 

2. Launch the installation by running 'install.bat'. This will fetch the dependencies required to run the software. 

3. Installation complete.
