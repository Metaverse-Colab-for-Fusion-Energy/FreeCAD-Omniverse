# FreeCAD Connector for NVIDIA Omniverse
This software connects CAD geometry on FreeCAD to NVIDIA Omniverse.

This has been tested for Windows devices (Win 10 & 11) running FreeCAD 0.20 and 0.21, with both local and remote Omniverse Nucleus setups, using Omniverse Connect Sample 202.0. 

## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your FreeCAD \Mod directory. Typically, this is C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\FreeCAD\Mod

Note: if the AppData\Roaming\FreeCAD\Mod file directory does not exist, you must first initialise this folder. To do this, launch FreeCAD, and on the toolbar click Tools > Addon Manager. If you are using the Addon Manager for the first time, a dialog box will open warning you that the addons in the Addon manager are not officially part of FreeCAD. It also presents several options related to the Addon manager's data usage. Adjust those options to your liking and press the OK button to continue. The \Mod directory should now exist. 

2. Launch the installation by running install.bat. This will fetch the dependencies required to run the software. 

3. Installation complete.
